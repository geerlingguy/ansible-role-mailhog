# Ansible Role: MailHog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog)

Installs [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), a Go-based SMTP server and web UI/API for displaying captured emails, on RedHat or Debian-based linux systems.

Also installs [mhsendmail](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail) so you can redirect system mail to MailHog's built-in SMTP server.

If you're using PHP and would like to route all PHP email into MailHog, you will need to update the `sendmail_path` configuration option in php.ini, like so:

    sendmail_path = "{{ mailhog_install_dir }}/mhsendmail"

(Replace `{{ mailhog_install_dir }}` with the actual MailHog installation directory, which is `/opt/mailhog` by defaultâ€”e.g. `/opt/mailhog/mhsendmail`).

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    mailhog_install_dir: /opt/mailhog

The directory into which the MailHog binary will be installed.

    mailhog_binary_url: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases/download/v0.2.1/MailHog_linux_amd64

The MailHog binary that will be installed. You can find the latest version or a 32-bit version by visiting the [MailHog project releases page](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases).

    mailhog_daemonize_bin_path: /usr/sbin/daemonize

The path to `daemonize`, which is used to launch MailHog via init script.

    mhsendmail_binary_url: https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail/releases/download/v0.2.0/mhsendmail_linux_amd64

The mhsendmail binary that will be installed. You can find the latest version or a 32-bit version by visiting the [mhsendmail project releases page](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail/releases).

## Overriding templates

If you want to configure MailHog using one of the [MailHog Configuration options](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md) which 
you can't customize via variables because an option isn't exposed, you can override the template used to start MailHog.

```yaml
mailhog_init_template: mailhog.init.j2
mailhog_unit_template: mailhog.unit.j2
```

You can either copy and modify the provided template, or extend it with [Jinja2 template inheritance](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#template-inheritance) and override the specific template block you need to change.
