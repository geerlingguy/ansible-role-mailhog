# Ansible Role: MailHog

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Installs [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), a Go-based SMTP server and web UI/API for displaying captured emails, on RedHat or Debian-based linux systems.

Also installs [mhsendmail](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail) so you can redirect system mail to MailHog's built-in SMTP server.

If you're using PHP and would like to route all PHP email into MailHog, you will need to update the `sendmail_path` configuration option in php.ini, like so:

    sendmail_path = "{{ mailhog_install_dir }}/mhsendmail"

(Replace `{{ mailhog_install_dir }}` with the actual MailHog installation directory, which is `/opt/mailhog` by defaultâ€”e.g. `/opt/mailhog/mhsendmail`).

## Requirements

None.
